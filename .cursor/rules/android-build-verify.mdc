# Android build verification

After making significant changes to the Android app (e.g. multiple files, architecture/DI/navigation changes, or when asked to verify), run a Gradle build from the **project root** to catch compile and configuration errors.

**From project root** `w:\AndroidStudioProjects\Cleanly`:

- **Verify build (recommended after big changes):**
  ```powershell
  .\gradlew.bat assembleDebug
  ```
- **Clean + build** if dependencies or generated code might be stale:
  ```powershell
  .\gradlew.bat clean assembleDebug
  ```

Prefer running these in the Cursor terminal so the AI can read the output and fix any reported errors.
